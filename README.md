The blueprint in charge of create the PCG data asset. It will be executed from
"create_pcg_data.py", from an Houdini python node using remote execution:
'/Game/Blueprints/BP_CreatePCGDATA'

The python script create_pcg_data is saved here, as it's in the "Content/Python" folder
it is be default in the UE python search paths:
'Game/Blueprints/Python/create_pcg_data.py'

The PCG data asset path created by Houdini, this can be customized ad the python node level:
'/Game/Maps/PCGData/PCGDATA_TestAsset'

The PCG graph which will read the data asset generated by Houdini:
'/Game/PCG/PCG_LoadAsset'

Core BP to define data structure, attribs etc.
'/Game/Blueprints/AttribTypes/*

Houdini example hipfile:
HoudiniToPCGData/Houdini/houdini_to_pcg_data_py.hiplc

The hip file will need to have access to:
HoudiniToPCGData/Houdini/create_unreal_pcg_data_asset.hdalc
and the python module:
HoudiniToPCGData/Houdini/upyrc

you can put both in your my documents folder as such:

MyDocuments/Houdini20.5/otls/create_unreal_pcg_data_asset.hdalc
MyDocuments/Houdini20.5/Scripts/Python/upyrc
